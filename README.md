# 📊 Sales Prediction & Visualization Using AWS

## 🧠 Objective
To **predict future sales using machine learning** and **visualize insights using AWS services**, providing actionable business intelligence.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **AWS S3** – For storage of datasets and prediction outputs.
- **Amazon QuickSight** – For building dashboards and visuals.
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- **XGBoost** – For regression-based sales prediction.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – For data analysis and EDA.

---

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. **Data Upload**
   - Uploaded raw dataset to an **S3 bucket**.

2. **Data Preprocessing & EDA**
   - Cleaned and explored the dataset using **Pandas** and visualized key trends.

3. **Model Training**
   - Built and trained an **XGBoost regression model** to predict sales.

4. **Prediction & Storage**
   - Saved predictions to a `.csv` file and uploaded it to **S3**.

5. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Connected **QuickSight** to the prediction file in S3.
   - Created visuals:
     - Predicted vs Actual Sales
     - Sales trends over time
     - Key product segments and regional insights

---

## ✅ Outcome

- A professional-quality **interactive dashboard** was created in **QuickSight**.
- Delivered **insights based on actual and predicted sales**.
- Demonstrated end-to-end use of **AWS services + Machine Learning** for business intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Deploy the model using **AWS Lambda** or **SageMaker Endpoint** for real-time predictions.
- Automate the pipeline using **AWS Glue** or **Step Functions**.
- Add alerting or anomaly detection for sudden sales changes.
